1. Untar snr-x.x.tar.gz;
2. Look into rrd/ subdirectory;
3. Create subdirectories in rrd/ with names of your base stations;
4. Don't forget to edit rrd/BASE_STATION/.community to set snmp-communities;
5. Look at etc/snr.conf and edit rrd_dir parameter
6. Try to run it: `sbin/snr.pl --debug-level=5 --log=/dev/stdout`;
7. If it works, configure your cron-daemon to run 'sbin/snr.pl' every */5;
8. Take enjoy;
9. Excuse me for my bad English, NO documentation and bugs you found;
P.S. You will need perl-5.6.1 and Net::SNMP module.
P.P.S. +rrdtool by T.Oetiker and RRDs perl module;
P.P.P.S. Don't forget about apache. If wou want to browse all your base
stations and clients, take it:
    ScriptAlias /snr/cgi-bin/ /usr/local/snr/cgi-bin/
    <Directory /usr/local/snr/cgi-bin>
        AllowOverride AuthConfig
    	Options +ExecCGI
    </Directory>
    Alias /snr/ /usr/local/snr/rrd/
    <Directory /usr/local/snr/rrd>
        AllowOverride AuthConfig Indexes
	Options +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
	RewriteEngine on
	RewriteRule ^(.+)\/(.+)\.rrd$ /snr/cgi-bin/snr.cgi?base=$1\&peer=$2\&step=86400 [R]
    </Directory>
mod_rewrite will redirect your browser to cgi-script when you will click at
simple .rrd file with database. Pretty useful. :)
